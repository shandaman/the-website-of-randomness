                <h3>Short Story 1</h3>
                <p>Crouching low behind a blueberry bush Ash focused her bow on a mother deer. She did not care for fawn, they were undeveloped and bad to eat. Her grip on the string loosened. The arrow flew 12 feet and buried itself in its target. It protruded out the mother deer’s ribcage.  Ash ran to the now still corpse, slung its dead body over her shoulder, and proceeded down the path to Gat-fall (Her home).
 A bundle of disoriented houses came into view as well as a shady group of men in dark clothing. They guarded the array of rocks that were supposed to be the fortified wall of the village. Ash quickly covered the deer with her own black jacket but she feared there was a leg hanging within view. She walked past the men avoiding eye contact. When she was well in front of the men she glanced behind her. They were following her. She could now see there faces. It was prince Khun and his three followers. Khun was the crime lord of Gat-fall, if you could call him that. There was hardly any crimes in Gat-fall, except for the occasional thief, but there sure were bullies, and Khun was one of them.
She quickly turned a corner and slowly passed the town police. As the men pursuing her saw the police and turned the other way. She was safe for now, but they would be back for the deer. She was sure that they had seen the leg, had they? Of course they had. Or had they just been up to their usual mischief.
When Ash reached her house she scraped the hide of the deer and started chopping the meat. Then she gathered the meat and put it in a huge pan. Ash cooked it until it browned, slowly stirring with a wooden spoon to even the cooking out.
 She ate her fill and gave the rest to the mother across the street. She knew the mother from her childhood but did not like to talk to her. She walked back to her house, undressed, and rolled onto her bed.
The next day as she walked through the town with no apparent reason, an old lady approached her. “Ooooh,” the old lady exclaimed,”You are sick, very very sick.” “Shut up old lady,” Ash said boldly, but on the inside she felt sick.
Ash ran the corner, shoving the old lady into an angry man. Ash did not care about anything but running to the nearest bucket. 
Her insides shot out of her mouth. She could see the chewed up chunks of meat. Why had she been sick. It was the deer, she had shot, grabbed and ate the wrong deer. She had eaten the young, undeveloped, fawn. 
Fawn are bad to eat. 10 people die a year from this mistake, in her village alone. She had just killed a family.
She woke up but found that she was so woozy she fell back asleep. When she woke again she was aware of her surrounding. She was in a bed. She was bedridden. The old lady that she had shoved earlier was trying to spoon feed her. With a gold and diamond spoon. Who made a gold and diamond spoon?
Then she realized the inscriptions on the spoon. Was this lady… no, witch trying to poison her. Was she trying to kill her. Trusting her instincts she snached the spoon and shoved it into the witch’s mouth. The witch started glowing. The room was enveloped with light.
When the light dimmed out the old ragged witch was replaced with a young beautiful woman.  “I was only trying to help,” the woman whispered. Ash black died. -SNF</p>

                <h3>Poseidon project</h3>
                <p>Poseidon, Neptune What ever you call him, Poseidon is the same earthshaker and sea master. According to http://www.worldbookonline.com 

¨Poseidon was the Greek god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses. The Romans identified him with their god Neptune. Poseidon was the son of Rhea and Cronus, members of a race of gods called the Titans. The gods Zeus and Hades were Poseidon's brothers. When the three brothers drew lots to divide the universe, Poseidon received the sea as his domain, Zeus the heavens, and Hades the underworld. All three brothers ruled the earth, but Zeus was in charge. Poseidon's wife was the sea goddess Amphitrite. They had two daughters and a son, the sea god Triton. Poseidon's offspring from countless love affairs included the magical horses Pegasus and Arion and the giants Antaeus and the one-eyed Polyphemus. In the epic poem the  Odyssey, Poseidon hated the Greek hero Odysseus (Ulysses in Latin) for blinding Polyphemus. In some myths, Poseidon was also the father of the mortal hero Theseus. Poseidon's attendants were the sea gods Phorcys, Proteus, and Nereus, and sea nymphs called Nereids. Like other sea deities, Poseidon often changed his shape. He drove a horse-drawn chariot and carried a three-pronged spear called a trident.¨ 
Fascinating isn't it? The World Book also says,(This time talking about the roman version)
 ¨Neptune was the god of the sea in Roman mythology. He had power over the sea and seafaring. For example, he could cause--or prevent--storms at sea. Neptune resembled the Greek god Poseidon. Like Poseidon, he was also the god of earthquakes and horses. The ancient Romans were a seafaring people and imported much of their food and other necessities by ship. As ruler of the sea, Neptune thus had an important role in their daily life. Sea travel was dangerous in ancient times, and Roman sailors prayed to Neptune for safe voyages. After their return, sailors often showed their gratitude by dedicating a valuable object to Neptune. Neptune was the son of Saturn and Ops (called Cronus and Rhea by the Greeks). He married the sea nymph Amphitrite, and they had a son, Triton, who was half man and half fish. Triton played an important role in many ancient legends about the sea. -JEP

                <h3>Are stress balls good or bad!</h3>
                <p>I reporter JEP was at the scene when the first Stress Ball had exploded! After investigating I found that the victim
of the explosion had perhaps squeezed the ball too tightly. Was this person telling the truth? I decided yes. A few days after the explosion the a
second explosion occurred! Was this sabotage? Was there no relation between the two
explosions? Could it all be the cause of one person? Officials were at the  sight in less than a minute with the supplies to clean the horrifying mess. There are bound to be more explosions. So stay cautious and on the alert. Be careful of everyone that has a stress ball, and try to stay away from them, or avoid them. If possible, try not to be rude about avoiding someone with a stress ball. These explosions can happen any time, at any place. You should practice avoiding dangerous places. If you follow on all of these rules nothing is likely to happen. But if it does, you will now what to do, and you will be prepaired. <br>-JEP<br>correcred by -SNF</p>
